Aviation is the field encompassing the design, development, production, operation, and use of aircraft. From its origins with the Wright brothers' first powered flight in 1903, aviation has grown into a global industry connecting people and goods across continents. It serves as a vital mode of transportation, enabling economic growth and cultural exchange. Aviation also includes private, commercial, and military branches, each contributing uniquely to the world’s connectivity and progress.
